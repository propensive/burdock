# Rudiments

__Rudimentary utilities for writing everyday Scala__

_Rudiments_ provides a small collection of tiny but useful utilities for everyday programming in Scala, and
could be considered an enhanced "predef".

## Features

- implementation of an easier-to-use Y-combinator method, `fix` with a recursion helper method, `recur`
- typesafe and mutation-safe reimplementations of several `String` operations
- `String` extractors for primitive types
- `unit`, `only`, `twin` and `triple` convenience methods to make some code patterns slightly more concise
- a typesafe `str""` string interpolator where all substitutions must be `String`s


## Availability

Rudiments has not yet been published. The medium-term plan is to build it with
[Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) and to publish it as a source build
on [Vent](https://github.com/propensive/vent). This will enable ordinary users
to write and build software which depends on Rudiments.

Subsequently, Rudiments will also be made available as a binary in the Maven
Central repository. This will enable users of other build tools to use it.

For the overeager, curious and impatient, see [building](#building).


## Getting Started

Utilities in _Rudiments_ are mostly provided through extension methods, and importing the `rudiments` package
will bring all utility methods into scope.

### Y-Combinator

An implementation of a [Y-Combinator](https://shorturl.at/jqKOY), called `fix`, is provided, implemented using a
Scala 3 context function, which enables slightly more favorable syntax than was possible in Scala 2. This method
makes it easier to write code in a point-free style.

The `fix` method takes a type parameter (which must be explicitly specified for type inference) and a lambda as
its first parameter, to which an additional parameter should be supplied as its initial value. Crucially, in the
body of `fix`'s lambda, a call to `recur` should be used to signal recursion.

This is best illustrated with an example. Here is an implementation of a factorial function.
```scala
def factorial(n: Int): Int =
  fix[Int] { i => if i <= 0 then 1 else i*recur(i - 1) } (n)
```

This avoids the explicit definition of a private or nested helper function, which would normally be necessary
for a definition such as this.

### Primitive `String` Extractors

Extractors for all the primitive types are provided for matching on `String`s. These are defines as extensions
to the (virtual) companion objects of the primitive types, so they have the same names as the types they
extract.

Here is an example of them in use:
```scala
def parse(number: String): Boolean | Int | Double =
  number match
    case Boolean(b) => b
    case Int(i)     => i
    case Double(d)  => d
    case _          => 0
```

### Typesafe `String` operations

The extension method `String#cut` has identical semantics to `String#split`, but returns an immutable `IArray`
instead of an `Array`. Likewise, the methods `String#bytes` and `String#chars` mirror `String#getBytes` and
`String#toCharArray`, returning an `IArray[Byte]` and `IArray[Char]` respectively.

The `bytes` method currently uses the `UTF-8` in all cases, though this may change if there is sufficient
demand.

Four variants of the extension method `join` are provided on `Traversable[String]` instances, which provide the
same functionality as `mkString` (but only operating on `String`s) with one additional two-parameter version
that's specialized for natural language lists where each element is separated by a comma except the last, which
is preceded by a word such as `and` or `or`.

For example,
```scala
List("one", "two", "three").join(", ", " or maybe ")
```
will produce the string `one, two or maybe three`.

### Lightweight system property access

Many JVM system properties are available in the map, `System.getProperties` and are typically given identifiers
written in a dot-notation style, such as `user.dir`. Rudiments provides syntactic sugar for accessing these
dynamically through the `Sys` object, for example,
```scala
val pwd: Option[String] = Sys.user.dir()
```

### `unit`

Often a side-effecting expression returns a value which is not used at a particular call site, and can be
discarded. However, the expression's return type can result in type-inference choosing an undesired return type,
when `Unit` would be preferable, or a compile-time warning about discarded values may be produced.

The `unit` extension method silently discards the return value of any expression, and instead produces a `Unit`,
`()`.

### `only`

The `only` extension method applies a partial function to a value and lifts the result into an option.

For example,
```scala
val result: Option[Int] = string.only { case Int(i) => i*i }
```

### `str""` Interpolator

The `s""` interpolator takes parameters of `Any` type as substitutions, calling `String#toString` on them as
necessary. This may be considered too permissive, so `str""` is provided as a typesafe alternative that requires
every substitution to be a `String`.

### `twin` and `triple`

These two extension methods produce a two-tuple and a three-tuple (respectively) of repetitions of the value it
is applied to. This can be useful in a subsequent `map` operation.





## Status

Rudiments is classified as __maturescent__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Rudiments is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 809 lines of code.

## Building

Rudiments will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Rudiments?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*
   
   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Rudiments's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Rudiments and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.
   
   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `rudiments`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Rudiments's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Rudiments are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/rudiments/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Rudiments
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

Rudiments was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and
training on all aspects of Scala 3 is available from [Propensive

## Name

The word _rudiment_ is defined as, "the principle which lies at the bottom of any development; an unfinished beginning", which is apt for a library whose purpose is to provide such common functionality that it might lie at the start of many other libraries.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
